Exploratory Data Analysis of the 2018 PISA School Survey

1. Introduction

The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a series of educational tests and surveys developed and managed by the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). PISA surveys students at age 15-16 as they approach the end of compulsory education to assess how well 
students have learned the school curriculum, and how well prepared they are for life beyond school.

PISA's aim is to gather comparable data that participating countries (that may or may not be OECD members) can use to improve their education policies 
and outcomes.

The latest PISA assessment took place in 2018 and consisted of 10 questionnaires completed by different education systems stakeholders (students, 
teachers, parents, and school principals). This project looks at the answers to the questionnaire filled in by school principals, called the School 
Survey and the 2018 average PISA scores for participating countries.

The dataset is available on Kaggle in a csv format, and on the PISA website in SAS and SPSS formats.

2. Research Questions

This project will explore the dataset visually looking at univariate, bivariate and multivariate descriptive statistics in order to answer the questions:

- Which education system/school characteristics had the strongest correlation with average 2018 PISA score?
- What were the effects of OECD membership on PISA performance?

The project's main variable of interest is the 2018 average PISA score per country as an indicator of student learning outcomes.

3. Conclusions

The dataset's visual exploration has provided important insights into our research questions.

- Which education system/school characteristics had the strongest correlation with average 2018 PISA score?

The average PISA scores have the strongest positive correlations with access to computers, smaller student-teacher ratio and inclusion of students with 
special needs. In other words, students education systems providing good access to computers, have more teachers per student and have included students 
with special needs achieve higher test scores. These variables can thus be viewed as indicators of education quality.

On the contrary, the scores are negatively correlated with the number of students from disadvantaged homes who the data show tend to study in schools 
with fewer teachers per student (student-teacher ratio), in larger classes and with fewer computers at their disposal. This is another reminder of 
education inquities persisting around the world.

In addition, higher levels of school help are associated with lower scores, suggesting that perhaps help is insufficient or inadequate. This result merits 
further investigation.

- What were the effects of OECD membership on 2018 PISA performance?

Inequities between countries are also visible when comparing the scores and other indicators of education quality between OECD member and non-member 
countries. OECD members tend to have higher average PISA scores, smaller class sizes, fewer disadvantaged students, and more students with special needs 
included in their education systems. As the OECD is an organization of wealthy developed countries, this appears to be reflected in the data on education 
outcomes.

- Other considerations:

The correlations found in this study are on a global level including all countries that participated in the 2018 PISA school survey. It is important to 
keep in mind that the strength and direction of these correlations may change when looking at individual countries or regions.

It is also worth remembering that these data were collected in 2018 before the coronavirus pandemic affected education systems globally. The next PISA 
assessment is due to take place this year (2023) and we can expect to see the pandemic's effect in the results.
